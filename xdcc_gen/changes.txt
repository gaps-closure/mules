Changes to the design spec json
- ensure that maximum string length and array length match what v1.0 needs.

Changes to the auto-generated xdcc code
- maximum array length is given in schema, which will be allocated. A given instance may have fewer elements and when encoding this needs to be incorporated.

updateConfig has no publishers
updateNewTasking has no publishers


Changes to the design spec json
DONE - change inMessages and outMessages in topology to inFlows and outFlows.
DONE - ensure each flow id is unique
DONE- ensure that the flows exactly match v1.0, including topic names.
DONE - remove fromComponent and toComponent in flow.
DONE - rename dataId to flowId
DONE - ensure that CLE JSON for messages do not arg, ret and cod taints.
DONE - argtaints for components is a list of lists. One list of allowable taint on each flowID. By conventation, we will list all in flows, followed by out flows.
DONE - combine annotations in message flow specs for a given message into the CDF block of the corresponding autogenerated echo function.

Changes to the auto-generated xdcc code
DONE - XDLINKAGE_* annotations must have a list of taints for each argument

* each flow should occur exactly once in the in or out flows block of a component
* each flow should occur exactly once in the in of one component and exactly once int the out flows block of another component
* the inFlows+outFlows of a component should match its argtaints in the CLE
* each flow in inFlows and outFlows must appear in the flows block
