Changes to the design spec json
- change inMessages and outMessages in topology to inFlows and outFlows.
- ensure that the flows exactly match v1.0, including topic names.
- remove fromComponent and toComponent in flow.
- ensure each flow id is unique
- rename dataId to flowId
- ensure that CLE JSON for messages do not arg, ret and cod taints.
- combine annotations in message flow specs for a given message into the CDF block of the corresponding autogenerated echo function.
- argtaints for components is a list of lists. One list of allowable taint on each flowID. By conventation, we will list all in flows, followed by out flows.
- ensure that maximum string length and array length match what v1.0 needs.

Changes to the auto-generated xdcc code
- XDLINKAGE_* annotations must have a list of taints for each argument
- maximum array length is given in schema, which will be allocated. A given instance may have fewer elements and when encoding this needs to be incorporated.
