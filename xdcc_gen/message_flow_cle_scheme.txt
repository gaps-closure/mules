Every component has a label, each label has associated cle-json; multiple labels could map to same level 

For each message type M (e.g., component_heartbeats) and component C
   - define a label      // will match outtaint of cle-json of C
   - in the associated cle-json, for each peer level specify a cdf

  level: green
  cdf: [
     {remotelevel: orange, operation: allow, ...},   
     {remotelevel: purple, operation: redact, ...}
  ]


All components on orange will get unredacted M from C
All components on purple will get redacted M from C

Green, Orange, DataID,  OPERATION-allow  -- class B policy
Green, Purple, DataID,  OPERATION-redact -- class B policy
    
component_heartbeats from MPU  has label CHGREEN_MPU
component_heartbeats from RDR  has label CHGREEN_RDR
component_heartbeats from ISRM has label CHORANGE_ISRM
