CLE Notes:

* All symbols and keywords in CLE are distinct and cannot be reused: case sensitive
* Enclave: a memory isolated computing environment with names such as ENCLAVE_ORANGE_0
* Level: a sensitivity level for which we use color names as identifiers such as green, orange, etc.
* An enclave operates at a single level
* Multiple enclaves may operate at the same level (e.g. ENCLAVE_ORANGE_WESTCOAST, ENCLAVE_ORANGE_WESTCOAST_GPU, ENCLAVE_ORANGE_EASTCOAST)

* An annotation includes a CLE-label and an associated CLE-JSON
* A CLE-label (e.g. ORANGE_SHAREABLE) is a symbol that represents certain cross domain security constraints which are specified in the associated JSON
* The associated CLE-JSON specifies security constraints to be defined later 

* There are two types of annotations:
1) Node Annotations
    * Developer can apply at most one node annotation to a local or a global variable
2) Function Annotations   
    * Developer can apply at most one function annotation to a function
    * Function annotations can only be applied to functions
    
* We anticipate a small number of functions and variables will be annotated
* Annoted functions are expected to be audited

CLE-JSON contents:
    level: specifies the program element assigned to an enclave with the designated level 
    cdf: array of cdf elements which contain
        * remotelevel: a level of a potential peer domain
            * For a node annotation, constrains whether data can flow from level to remotelevel
            * For a function annotation, constrains whether the function can be called cross domain from remotelevel
        * guardoperation: allow, redact, deny
            * deny is provided as a convenience 
        * direction: ingress, egress, bidirectional
            * Direction is ignored for now. Intended to signal push vs. pull of data
        * oneway: bool
            * Signals if true there is a data diode between level and remotelevel
            * Implication: When applied to function annotations, cross domain invocations cannot use returned data
            * For level equal to remotelevel, does not make sense to set oneway to true
        * argtaints: a list of sets of CLE-labels where the length of the list is the number of parameters
            * Only applies to function annotations
            * The respective elements of the list correspond to the respective parameters of the function
            * The argument passed to the corresponding parameters must have a (potentially inferred) CLE-Label that matches one of the labels specified in the set 
        * rettaints: (To be continued...)



* There can be at most 1 cdf element per remotelevel within a CLE-JSON of an annotation 
* There can be a cdf element with level equal to remotelevel
* If the cdf for a remotelevel is missing, it is equivalent to deny
* Every cdf element in a function annotation must contain argtaints, codtaints, and rettaints.
* Variable argument functions are not supported, only for annotated functions. Other functions can have variable arity.
